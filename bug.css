The CSS `calc()` function can produce unexpected results if you're not careful with operator precedence and unit handling.  For example, `width: calc(100% - 20px);` works fine, but `width: calc(100% - 20);` will likely cause issues because the units are missing from the 20px value.  Another issue is incorrect nesting or mixing of functions within `calc()`, which the browser may not be able to correctly parse leading to unexpected results.
