# CSS `calc()` Function Errors

This repository demonstrates common and uncommon errors that can occur when using the CSS `calc()` function.  The `bug.css` file contains examples of problematic code, while `bugSolution.css` provides corrected versions.

**Common Issues:**
* **Missing Units:**  Forgetting to specify units (like `px`, `%`, `em`, etc.) in values within the `calc()` function.
* **Incorrect Nesting/Mixing:**  Improperly nesting or combining different functions within `calc()`, leading to parsing errors.
* **Operator Precedence:**  Unintended operator precedence, which can lead to unexpected calculations.

This repository is intended to help developers understand and avoid these common pitfalls when working with the CSS `calc()` function.
